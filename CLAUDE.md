## Technical Implementation Details

### Financial Health Calculation
- Investment income calculation: 3.5% on liquid assets + 1.5% on real estate
- Emergency fund target: 3 months of expenses
- Debt-free criteria: debt-to-assets â‰¤15% OR total debt â‰¤2x annual income

### Key Models & Methods
- `User#financial_health_level` - Returns current health level
- `User#financial_recommendations` - Returns array of recommendation strings
- `User#recommendations_with_links` - Returns recommendations with affiliate URLs
- `Objective#monthly_savings_needed` - Compound interest calculation
- `Objective#investment_recommendation` - Returns appropriate product code
- `Objective#savings_capacity_analysis` - Checks if user can afford monthly savings

### Testing Status
- âœ… All financial engine components tested and working
- âœ… Multiple scenarios tested (different health levels, objectives, affiliate links)
- âœ… Compound interest calculations verified
- âœ… Savings capacity analysis working

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES - User-Facing Implementation
**Complete these BEFORE Phase 3:**

### âœ… COMPLETED User Interface Foundation:
1. âœ… **Navigation menu** - Clean navbar with relevant links (login, signup, dashboard, objectives, etc.)
2. âœ… **Landing page completion** - Finish all sections with proper content and working links
3. ðŸ”² **Dashboard implementation** - Show financial health level, recommendations, objectives with real data
4. ðŸ”² **Forms integration** - Ensure financial forms update health calculations in real-time

### âœ… Landing Page Features Completed:
- Hero section with step-by-step cards and hover effects
- Features section with "100% Gratuito" highlight
- Objectives section with clickable cards and animations
- Testimonials with slide-in animations
- FAQ section with auto-open first question
- Footer with particles background and social links
- Responsive design across all sections
- Subtle animations and interactive elements

### Why This Order:
- Users can't see the financial engine we built until dashboard is complete
- Landing page needs proper navigation to be functional  
- Dashboard will demonstrate all Phase 2 work in action
- This creates a complete user experience before adding gamification

## ðŸŽ¯ NEXT: Complete User Interface Foundation
**Need to finish UI foundation before Phase 3:**

### ðŸ”² IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. **Dashboard implementation** - Show financial health level, recommendations, objectives with real data
2. **Forms integration** - Ensure financial forms update health calculations in real-time

### âœ… Current Status:
- âœ… Professional landing page with animations and interactions
- âœ… Clean navigation menu and footer
- âœ… Financial engine fully functional and tested (backend)
- âœ… All models and calculations working properly
- ðŸ”² **Missing: Dashboard UI to display the financial engine results**
- ðŸ”² **Missing: Forms integration with real-time calculations**

### After Dashboard Completion:
**Then ready for Phase 3: User Engagement features**
- Gamification elements with progress tracking
- User onboarding flow
- Enhanced dashboard visualizations
- Email notifications

## Technical Notes
- Rails 7.2.2.1 application
- Models: User, Balance, Pyg, Objective, Influencer
- User automatically gets default Balance and Pyg records on signup
- Objective status: pending, active, completed, cancelled
- All calculations handle edge cases (missing data, zero values)
