# BaiFinanzas Development Progress

## Project Overview
Financial platform with influencer referral system focused on helping users achieve financial health through personalized recommendations and investment guidance.

## Development Phases

### ✅ PHASE 1: Core Foundation (Week 1-2) - COMPLETED
1. ✅ Complete mobile-first responsive design - Fix all forms and dashboard for mobile
2. ✅ Finish landing page components - Complete hero, features, testimonials, FAQ, CTA sections  
3. ✅ Add referral tracking - Implement signup with influencer referral codes
4. ✅ Basic form validation - Ensure all financial forms work properly

### ✅ PHASE 2: Financial Engine (Week 3-4) - COMPLETED
5. ✅ **Financial scoring system** - 6-level health system implemented:
   - "Iniciando" → Negative/minimal cash flow
   - "Construyendo Base" → Building 3-month emergency fund
   - "Liberándose de Deudas" → Paying off credit cards + personal loans
   - "Invirtiendo en Objetivos" → Has emergency fund, no expensive debt, positive cash flow
   - "Acomodado" → Net worth ≥€250k AND debt-free (debt-to-assets ≤15% OR debt ≤2x annual income)
   - "Libertad Financiera" → Investment income ≥ monthly expenses

6. ✅ **Recommendation engine** - Product suggestions based on financial health level:
   - Basic recommendations per level (bank accounts, debt optimization, etc.)
   - Objective-specific investment recommendations
   - Integration with influencer affiliate links

7. ✅ **Compound interest calculator** - Objective-specific calculations:
   - Short-term (0-2 years): 1.5% return → `ac_diposit`
   - Medium-term (2-5 years): 3% return → `ac_curt`  
   - Long-term (5+ years): 8% return → `ac_llarg`
   - Retirement objectives: 8% return → `ac_jubil`
   - Savings capacity analysis with deficit detection

8. ✅ **Affiliate link integration** - Connect recommendations to influencer URLs:
   - Influencer model has fields: ac_compte, ac_cdiposit, ac_curt, ac_llarg, ac_deute, ac_jubil
   - User.recommendations_with_links() returns products with affiliate URLs
   - Automatic mapping based on recommendation type

### 🔄 PHASE 3: User Engagement (Week 5-6) - NEXT
9. 🔲 Gamification elements - Progress bars, completion badges, financial health levels
10. 🔲 User onboarding flow - Guided tour for new users  
11. 🔲 Dashboard enhancements - Better data visualization and insights
12. 🔲 Email notifications - Objective reminders and plan updates

### 🔲 PHASE 4: Business Optimization (Week 7-8) - PENDING
13. 🔲 Analytics tracking - User behavior and conversion tracking
14. 🔲 A/B testing setup - Test different recommendation presentations
15. 🔲 Performance optimization - Page load speed and mobile performance
16. 🔲 Admin dashboard - Influencer management and commission tracking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Financial Health Calculation
- Investment income calculation: 3.5% on liquid assets + 1.5% on real estate
- Emergency fund target: 3 months of expenses
- Debt-free criteria: debt-to-assets ≤15% OR total debt ≤2x annual income

### Key Models & Methods
- `User#financial_health_level` - Returns current health level
- `User#financial_recommendations` - Returns array of recommendation strings
- `User#recommendations_with_links` - Returns recommendations with affiliate URLs
- `Objective#monthly_savings_needed` - Compound interest calculation
- `Objective#investment_recommendation` - Returns appropriate product code
- `Objective#savings_capacity_analysis` - Checks if user can afford monthly savings

### Testing Status
- ✅ All financial engine components tested and working
- ✅ Multiple scenarios tested (different health levels, objectives, affiliate links)
- ✅ Compound interest calculations verified
- ✅ Savings capacity analysis working

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES - User-Facing Implementation
**Complete these BEFORE Phase 3:**

### 🎯 Next Session Plan (in order):
1. **Navigation menu** - Clean navbar with relevant links (login, signup, dashboard, objectives, etc.)
2. **Landing page completion** - Finish all sections with proper content and working links
3. **Dashboard implementation** - Show financial health level, recommendations, objectives with real data
4. **Forms integration** - Ensure financial forms update health calculations in real-time

### Why This Order:
- Users can't see the financial engine we built until dashboard is complete
- Landing page needs proper navigation to be functional  
- Dashboard will demonstrate all Phase 2 work in action
- This creates a complete user experience before adding gamification

## Next Session Goals (After UI completion):
1. Start Phase 3: User Engagement features
2. Implement gamification elements with progress tracking
3. Create user onboarding flow
4. Enhance dashboard with better data visualization

## Technical Notes
- Rails 7.2.2.1 application
- Models: User, Balance, Pyg, Objective, Influencer
- User automatically gets default Balance and Pyg records on signup
- Objective status: pending, active, completed, cancelled
- All calculations handle edge cases (missing data, zero values)
