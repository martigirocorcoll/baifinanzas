        q1:
          question: "How does the app calculate my financial health?"
          answer_1: "Our app analyzes your complete financial situation using our own methodology. We evaluate your monthly cash flow, emergency fund, debts, and net worth to determine your current level of financial health."
          answer_2: "There are 6 levels and each has specific recommendations tailored to your personal situation. All information is kept private and secure."
        q2:
          question: "Are the recommendations really personalized?"
          answer_1: "Yes, absolutely. Each recommendation is generated specifically for your unique financial situation."
          answer_2: "For example, if you have credit card debt, we'll recommend debt consolidation products. If you already have an emergency fund, we'll suggest appropriate investments."
        q3:
          question: "How do the goal calculations work?"
          answer_1: "We use compound interest formulas to calculate how much you need to save monthly to reach your goals. Expected returns vary depending on the term and your risk tolerance."
          answer_2: "We also analyze your current savings capacity and alert you if a goal is not realistic with your current financial situation, suggesting more viable alternatives."
        q4:
          question: "Is the app really free?"
          answer_1: "Yes, the app is 100% free for all users. There are no hidden costs, no premium subscriptions, and no fees for using our services. We'll never ask you to pay to access your personalized financial plan."
          answer_2: "We are funded solely through affiliate commissions when you choose to purchase recommended products, but this doesn't affect the price you pay or influence our recommendations."
        q5:
          question: "What happens with my personal data?"
          answer_1: "Your privacy is our priority. All your financial data is stored securely and encrypted. We never share your personal information with third parties, and only you have access to your personalized financial plan."
          answer_2: "You can delete your account and all your data at any time from your profile settings."
        q6:
          question: "Can I change my financial goals?"
          answer_1: "Of course. We understand that circumstances change, and your financial plan should adapt to your life. You can modify, delete, or add any goal from your dashboard at any time."
          answer_2: "When you change a goal, the app will automatically recalculate your plan and provide you with new recommendations tailored to your new financial goals."

          description: "Identify hidden savings opportunities in your daily life. Most people can free up between 10% and 30% of their income without sacrificing quality of life, simply by being more aware of where their money goes. This is the first step to get out of a critical situation and start building your financial future."
        ac_llarg:
          title: "Invest for the long term and reach your goals with less effort"
          description_html: "When you have a goal more than 5 years away, <strong>time is your best ally</strong>. Leaving your money sitting in a checking account means losing purchasing power to inflation (≈2-3% annually). Investing in globally diversified equity funds allows you to grow your wealth by leveraging global economic growth, with enough time to absorb market volatility. The key is to start as soon as possible, contribute regularly (Dollar Cost Averaging), and let compound interest work for you. With the right time horizon, investing stops being speculation and becomes the most efficient way to achieve big goals."
        ac_curt:
          title: "Invest for the medium term with balanced security and returns"
          description_html: "For goals between <strong>2 and 5 years</strong>, you need balance: more returns than a deposit, but less risk than equities. Fixed income funds allow you to obtain moderate returns (≈3% annually) with much lower volatility than the stock market. It's the perfect middle ground for goals like a home down payment, home renovation, or any medium-term project. You have enough time for your money to grow above inflation, but not so much to take on equity volatility."

          description: "As your wealth and income grow, taxes become your largest annual expense. The difference between paying what's fair and overpaying can amount to thousands (or tens of thousands) of euros each year. Good tax planning isn't tax evasion, it's intelligently structuring your finances to comply with the law while paying only what's required. Discover how a specialized tax advisor can help you optimize your income tax, plan inheritances, and choose the best structure for your investments and businesses."
        portfolio_optimization:
          title: "Optimize your investment portfolio with an independent second opinion"
          description: "If you already have an investment portfolio, it's essential to ensure it's well-structured and aligned with your goals. Banks and private banking services often recommend their own products, which aren't always the most suitable for you. An independent second opinion helps you identify conflicts of interest, hidden risks in complex products, and opportunities for improvement. Receive a free analysis of your current situation and discover if your portfolio is truly optimized or if there's room for improvement."

          description_html: "Your mortgage is probably your largest monthly expense for 20-30 years. A reduction of just 0.5 points in the interest rate can save you tens of thousands of euros over the life of the loan. The mortgage market constantly changes, but your bank won't call you to offer better conditions. The question is simple: <strong>are you paying more than necessary for your mortgage?</strong> A mortgage broker can analyze your current situation at no cost and show you if you can pay less each month for the same thing. If you can save, why wouldn't you?"

              - question: "Do I have to close my previous account?"
                answer: "Not necessarily. You can keep both accounts active. The usual approach is to migrate gradually: first open the new account, then move your banking operations progressively. If your previous account has no fees, you can even keep it open without problems. Only close the old one when you're 100% comfortable with the new one."
              - question: "What if I don't like the new account?"
                answer: "No problem. Fee-free accounts have no commitment period or cancellation penalty. You can close it whenever you want at no cost.

            items:
              - question: "Why a separate place and not leave it in my checking account?"
                answer: "For three reasons: mental separation (you don't spend it impulsively), profitability (it earns interest while you're not using it), and availability (you can access it when you really need it since it's not locked)."
              - question: "What if I need the money before reaching the required amount?"
                answer: "This money is for unexpected events. If one happens while you're still building it, you'll be grateful you started. Don't worry, use the money you've saved here for it and continue saving until you can complete it and continue on your path to financial improvement."
              - question: "How long does it take to build a complete emergency fund?"
                answer: "It depends on your savings capacity. The important thing is to start and be consistent. A partial fund already protects you better than having nothing. And the sooner you start, the sooner you'll have it complete."
              - question: "What if I have debts? Should I pay them first or create the fund first?"
                answer: "If you have expensive debts (credit cards with high interest), balance both things: first create a small 1-month expense fund, then attack the debts, and when you reduce them, complete your fund. A small safety fund allows you to start paying debts without incurring more debt if an unexpected event comes."

          faq:

              - question: "Why attack the smallest debt first and not the one with the highest interest?"
                answer: "Mathematically, paying the debt with the highest interest first saves more money (Avalanche method). But psychologically, most people give up before seeing results. The Snowball method gives you quick wins: eliminating a debt completely is a huge motivational boost. You'll see results in months, not years. Motivation is the key to maintaining the plan long-term."
              - question: "Do I need to hire professional help for this?"
                answer: "Not necessarily. The Snowball method is simple and you can execute it yourself with discipline and consistency. However, if you want a deeper guide, the recommended book explains the entire process step by step, with real examples and practical tools. It's an investment in financial education that will serve you for life. You don't need an expensive advisor, just clear knowledge and consistent action."
              - question: "What about my mortgage? Do I also pay it with this method?"
                answer: "No. The mortgage is \"acceptable debt\" because it usually has low interest (3-5%) and finances an asset that can appreciate. First attack the BAD debts: credit cards, personal loans, consumer financing (15-25% interest). Once you've eliminated those, if you want to optimize your mortgage (get a better interest rate or reduce fees), that action is in your personalized plan. But it's not urgent like expensive debts."
              - question: "How long will it take me to get out of debt?"
                answer: "It depends on your amount of debt and your payment capacity. But here's an encouraging fact: most people who follow this method with discipline eliminate their expensive debts in 12-24 months. Quick wins (first debt eliminated in 3-6 months) keep you motivated to continue. The important thing is to start TODAY. Every month you wait is another month paying interest you could avoid."

Most people are surprised to discover they spend €200-300/month on things they don't even remember. Once you know this, you can act. After identifying your dispensable expenses and eliminating them, you won't need to track as much. What's important is the FIRST 30-day tracking."

                answer: "Strict budgets often fail because they're too restrictive and hard to maintain. Our method is different: we don't tell you \"you can only spend X on Y\". Instead, we help you identify expenses you DON'T EVEN VALUE (forgotten subscriptions, impulse purchases) and eliminate them without sacrifice. It's more realistic and sustainable. You keep what matters to you, eliminate what doesn't."
              - question: "I already know what I spend on, I just don't earn enough..."
                answer: "Most people think they know what they spend on, but when they do the real tracking they discover invisible expenses of €50-200/month they hadn't accounted for. Small automatic charges, forgotten subscriptions, impulse purchases... add up more than you think. Do the experiment: track for 30 days and then decide if the problem is really just income or if there are also opportunities to optimize expenses."
              - question: "What apps do you recommend for tracking?"
                answer: "You can use specialized apps like Mint (automatic reading of bank transactions), YNAB (very visual and simple), or simply your bank's app if it has expense categorization. If you prefer something more manual and personalized, use our free Google Sheets/Excel template. What's important isn't the tool, but the HABIT of reviewing your expenses consciously."
              - question: "I've tried to save before and always fail. Why would it be different now?"
                answer: "You probably tried the restrictive approach: \"I'm going to spend less on everything\". That doesn't work because it requires constant willpower. Our method is different: first you OBSERVE (track without judging), then you IDENTIFY specific expenses you don't value, and finally you ELIMINATE them permanently (cancel subscriptions, automate savings, implement simple rules). It's not willpower, it's a SYSTEM. Systems work better than motivation."

We need to differentiate:</p><p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Tax evasion (ILLEGAL):</strong> Hiding income, using fake invoices, not declaring income, undeclared tax havens.

We're talking about savings that can represent thousands of euros annually, or tens of thousands in complex planning like inheritances.</p><p class=\"mb-0\">If you have annual income above €60k, significant wealth (>€200k), you're self-employed or a business owner, or expect to receive/give significant inheritances, it's very likely a tax advisor will find relevant optimizations in your case.

If you need the money sooner, better a deposit. But if you have time, investing in globally diversified funds is statistically safer than leaving it idle (where you're guaranteed to lose purchasing power to inflation).</p>"

In 2028, another 30%. In 2029, the rest. This way, you arrive at 2030 with the money available and no last-minute volatility risk.</p><p class=\"mb-0\">This combines the best of both worlds: <strong>maximum growth during the long phase + safety when you approach your goal</strong>.</p>"

You can start with €50-100/month if that's what you can afford now.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">What's critical is not starting with a lot, but <strong>starting as soon as possible</strong> and being consistent. It's better to contribute €100/month for 10 years than wait to \"have more\" and lose years of compound interest.</p><p class=\"mb-0\">Plus, you can gradually increase contributions when your situation improves (salary raises, expense reductions).

If you withdraw money at a bad market moment (crisis), you could have losses.

              - question: "Is investing in fixed income safe? Can I lose money?"
                answer_html: "<p class=\"mb-2\">Fixed income is <strong>much safer than equities</strong>, but it's not 100% risk-free. The fluctuations are smaller:</p><ul class=\"mb-2\"><li><strong>Equities:</strong> Can drop -20% to -40% in bad years</li><li><strong>Fixed income:</strong> Typically drops -3% to -8% maximum in short periods</li></ul><p class=\"mb-2\">The main risks of fixed income are:</p><ul class=\"mb-2\"><li><strong>Interest rates:</strong> If rates rise, existing bonds temporarily drop (but recover over time)</li><li><strong>Default:</strong> If you invest in poor quality bonds (junk bonds), the issuer might not pay. That's why we recommend \"investment grade\" funds (quality bonds)</li></ul><p class=\"mb-0\">For <strong>2-5 year</strong> timeframes, fixed income offers an ideal balance: better returns than deposits (≈3% vs 1.5%) with moderate and manageable risk. It's the perfect middle ground.</p>"
              - question: "Why not use a deposit if it's safer?"
                answer_html: "<p class=\"mb-2\">Deposits are perfect for <strong>0-2 years</strong>, but for longer periods you lose returns:</p><div class=\"table-responsive mb-3\"><table class=\"table table-bordered small\"><thead class=\"table-light\"><tr><th>Term</th><th>Deposit (1.5%)</th><th>Fixed income (3%)</th><th>Difference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>€10,000 over 3 years</td><td>€10,457</td><td>€10,927</td><td class=\"text-success\"><strong>+€470</strong></td></tr><tr><td>€300/month x 3 years</td><td>€11,006</td><td>€11,271</td><td class=\"text-success\"><strong>+€265</strong></td></tr><tr><td>€10,000 over 5 years</td><td>€10,773</td><td>€11,593</td><td class=\"text-success\"><strong>+€820</strong></td></tr><tr><td>€300/month x 5 years</td><td>€18,684</td><td>€19,364</td><td class=\"text-success\"><strong>+€680</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"mb-0\"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> If you have 2-5 years ahead and can handle moderate volatility (-3% to -8%), fixed income gives you significantly more money in the end. The additional risk is justified by the timeframe.</p>"
              - question: "How much money do I need to start?"
                answer_html: "<p class=\"mb-2\">Most modern platforms <strong>have no minimum</strong>. You can start with €200-500/month if you're saving for a specific 2-5 year goal.</p><p class=\"mb-2\">If you have savings sitting idle in a checking account (€5,000-20,000) that you know you won't need for 2+ years, it's the perfect time to move them to fixed income. You gain ≈1.5% more annually than leaving them idle.</p><p class=\"mb-0\"><strong>Tip:</strong> Combine initial contribution (if you have it) + automatic monthly contribution. This way you maximize time generating returns AND keep building your goal each month.</p>"
              - question: "Can I withdraw the money early if I need it?"
                answer_html: "<p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Yes, you have full liquidity.</strong> Fixed income funds allow you to withdraw your money whenever you want (usually in 2-3 business days).</p><p class=\"mb-2\">But keep in mind:</p><ul class=\"mb-2\"><li>If you withdraw when the fund is temporarily negative (due to interest rate rises), you materialize the loss</li><li>If you wait, the fund recovers over time (bonds mature and return the capital)</li></ul><p class=\"mb-0\"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Only invest money you can leave for 2+ years. If you think you might need liquidity sooner, better to leave it in a savings account or deposit (even if you earn less).</p>"

              - question: "Pension plan or index funds? Which is better for me?"
                answer_html: "<p class=\"mb-2\">It depends on your tax situation and whether liquidity concerns you:</p><p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Pension plan:</strong> Ideal ONLY if you have a high tax rate (>37%) AND you don't mind having your money locked until retirement. You can deduct up to €8,000/year, which represents significant immediate tax savings. But that money is locked (except for exceptions like serious illness).</p><p class=\"mb-0\"><strong>Index funds:</strong> Recommended for almost everyone. You have full liquidity (you can withdraw money whenever you want), equally low fees, and you don't lose flexibility. Ideal if you want financial freedom before 65 or simply prefer having control over your money. You don't get an immediate tax advantage, but you only pay taxes on gains when you sell.</p>"
              - question: "What if I can't contribute the recommended amount?"
                answer: "Start with what you can, even if it's €50-100/month. What's critical isn't the initial amount but consistency and time. It's better to contribute €100/month for 30 years than to try contributing €500/month, not being able to maintain it, and quitting after 6 months. Plus, you can gradually increase contributions when your situation improves (salary raises, expense reductions, debt elimination). Many people start with €100/month and end up contributing €300-500/month years later."
              - question: "Is investing in index funds safe? Can I lose money?"
                answer: "In the short term (1-3 years) there is volatility and you may have temporary losses. If you invest €10,000 today, in 1 year you could have €9,000 (crisis) or €11,000 (bull market). It's unpredictable in the short term. BUT historically, in periods of more than 12 years, diversified global indices (like MSCI World or S&P 500) have been positive 99% of the time. Time dramatically reduces risk. That's why this strategy is ONLY for money you don't need to touch for 12+ years. If you need it sooner, better a deposit or high-yield savings account (even if you earn less)."
              - question: "Can I withdraw money before retirement if I need it?"
                answer_html: "<p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>Pension plans:</strong> Locked until retirement (except for exceptions like serious illness, long-term unemployment, or mortgage foreclosure). You can't access it for other emergencies.</p><p class=\"mb-0\"><strong>Index funds:</strong> Full liquidity. You can withdraw whenever you want (in 2-3 business days the money is in your account). Useful for early retirement, serious emergencies, or any unexpected event. <strong>That's why we recommend index funds instead of pension plans for almost everyone</strong>. Liquidity gives you flexibility and peace of mind.</p>"
              - question: "What if there's a crisis right when I'm about to retire and I lose everything?"
                answer: "That's why the \"glide path\" or de-escalation strategy exists. 5-10 years before retiring, you gradually reduce exposure to equities (stocks) and increase fixed income (bonds) and deposits. For example: at 55 you have 90% stocks / 10% bonds. At 60: 70% stocks / 30% bonds. At 65 (retirement): 40% stocks / 60% bonds/deposits. This way, on your retirement day you WON'T have everything in the stock market vulnerable to crises. You'll have most in stable assets. You only keep some stocks to continue growing during retirement."
